# Overview

These are the top-level contracts of the project.

- [LooksRareAggregator](https://github.com/code-423n4/2022-11-looksrare/blob/main/contracts/LooksRareAggregator.sol): An NFT liquidity aggregator that allows anyone to buy ERC721/ERC1155 tokens from multiple
  marketplaces in a single transaction. Users can only execute trades through proxies that have been whitelisted
  by the contract owner.

- [ERC20EnabledLooksRareAggregator](https://github.com/code-423n4/2022-11-looksrare/blob/main/contracts/ERC20EnabledLooksRareAggregator.sol): The entrypoint for purchases that are denominated in ERC20 tokens instead of
  native ETH. It still executes trades through LooksRareAggregator. The purpose of having an extra aggregator is to prevent LooksRareAggregator's ownership from being compromised and malicious proxies can steal users' ERC20 tokens.

- [LooksRareProxy](https://github.com/code-423n4/2022-11-looksrare/blob/main/contracts/proxies/LooksRareProxy.sol) : A proxy to execute trades on LooksRare.

- [SeaportProxy](https://github.com/code-423n4/2022-11-looksrare/blob/main/contracts/proxies/SeaportProxy.sol): A proxy to execute trades on Seaport.

# Out of Scope

- [V0Aggregator](https://github.com/code-423n4/2022-11-looksrare/blob/main/contracts/prototype/V0Aggregator.sol)
- [@looksrare/contract-exchange-v1](https://github.com/looksrare/contracts-exchange-v1)

## Focus

The main area of focus is on the 2 aggregators and the 2 proxies,

1. whether it is possible for a buyer to execute a malicious function call
2. whether it is possible for any tokens (ETH / ERC20 / ER721 / ERC1155) to be trapped inside the contracts
3. whether it is possible for any assets to be stolen


# Additional Context

## Fees

Fees logic is only implemented in SeaportProxy because the LooksRare protocol already charges a fee.

Contract owners can set the fee basis point and recipient for each proxy. Before executing a trade, the client should fetch each proxy's
fee data and include the returned basis points in the trade data's `maxFeeBp` parameter to prevent the fee basis points from suddenly icnreasing
beyond the buyer's acceptable fee levels.

If a trade contains multiple orders and they are denominated in different currencies, they should be sorted by currency in the client to reduce
the number of ETH/ERC20 transfers.

## Atomicity

Buyers can decide whether they want their transactions to be all-or-nothing or accepting partial executions with the bool flag `isAtomic`.

## Proxies

Proxies can only be called in the context of `LooksRareAggregator` through `delegatecall`.
The line `if (address(this) != aggregator) revert InvalidCaller();` does it.

```

# Quickstart (From `git clone` to running all tests in one line)

```
rm -Rf 2022-11-looksrare || true && git clone https://github.com/code-423n4/2022-11-looksrare.git && cd 2022-11-looksrare && yarn install && cp .env.template .env && FORGE_GAS_REPORT=true FOUNDRY_PROFILE=local forge test
```

# Install dependencies

```
yarn install
```

# Build

To reduce wait time, run any build/test related commands with FOUNDRY_PROFILE=local.
It turns off the Yul IR pipeline.

```
cp .env.template .env
FOUNDRY_PROFILE=local forge build
```

# Tests

## Foundry tests

```
cp .env.template .env
forge test # via_ir: true
FOUNDRY_PROFILE=local forge test # via_ir: false
```

## Gas benchmark

```
FOUNDRY_PROFILE=local forge test --match-contract GemSwapBenchmarkTest
FOUNDRY_PROFILE=local forge test --match-contract LooksRareProxyBenchmarkTest
FOUNDRY_PROFILE=local forge test --match-contract SeaportProxyBenchmarkTest
```

## Static analysis

```
pip3 install slither-analyzer
pip3 install solc-select
solc-select install 0.8.17
solc-select use 0.8.17
slither --solc solc-0.8.17 .
```

### Notes on slither

- There are a number of ignored detectors in `slither.config.json`. We have reviewed every warning and deemed those to be safe
to ignore.

- You will run into the error `Missing function Incorrect ternary conversion marketplace.fulfillAdvancedOrder{value: if currency == address(0) then price else 0}(advancedOrder,new CriteriaResolver[](0),bytes32(0),recipient) contracts/proxies/SeaportProxy.sol#199-218` when you first run `slither`, the solution is to move `currency == address(0) ? price : 0` to its own variable. Although we have `via_ir` turned on for production environment, we have decided to keep it turned off locally as it takes a long time to build. Therefore we are not able to make this ternary operator its own variable without running into the `Stack Too Deep` error.

## Coverage

```
forge coverage --report lcov
LCOV_EXCLUDE=("test/*" "contracts/prototype/*")
