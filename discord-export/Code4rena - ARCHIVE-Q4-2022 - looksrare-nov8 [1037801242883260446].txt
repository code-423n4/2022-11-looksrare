hi all


[11/08/2022 22:27] aviggiano
I have a question: what's the point of `TokenRescuer` transferring everything - 1 on `rescueETH` and `rescueER20`?


[11/08/2022 22:50] hiroshilooksrare
For gas savings

{Reactions}
👍 

[11/09/2022 00:47] trustminimised
Can you elaborate? I'm not following what the savings is here. Sorry if it's a dumb question, but I haven't seen this before.


[11/09/2022 08:16] hiroshilooksrare
it is because if we leave 1 wei in ETH or whichever ERC20 tokens in the contract, when a transfer from a user happens, it is not writing to storage from zero to nonzero and instead nonzero to nonzero and it costs less gas

Hello, is it normal that first time forge build takes 4000+ seconds?


[11/09/2022 10:58] hiroshilooksrare
Try running with `FOUNDRY_PROFILE=local forge build`


[11/09/2022 11:05] wardog94
I have that exported


[11/09/2022 11:12] hiroshilooksrare
can you try running the command above instead of exporting the env var


[11/09/2022 12:54] wardog94
My mistake, I set it incorrectly. Now builds in 150 sec


[11/09/2022 13:36] hiroshilooksrare
it should still not take 150 seconds

I use the command "FOUNDRY_PROFILE=local forge build --use solc:0.8.17", then it can build most of the files. But still there is one file that has error. But this can be fixed manually by changing the compiler version in ERC1271Contract.sol . If there is some better way, please suggest.

Which erc20 tokens are supposed to be supported?


[11/10/2022 10:44] hiroshilooksrare
For the purpose of the contest it should assume any ERC20 tokens, but realistically it should cover at least WETH/USDC/DAI

What's the generic marketplace proxy which calls a generic sweep function ? is it used for now?


[11/10/2022 16:23] hiroshilooksrare
it just means in the future we might integrate with new marketplaces


[11/10/2022 16:24] koolexc
Gotcha


[11/10/2022 16:24] hiroshilooksrare
and the proxy should always follow `IProxy`


[11/10/2022 16:24] koolexc
Makes sense 👍🏻


[11/10/2022 17:06] samater_
if purchases in ERC20EnabledLooksRareAggregator are denoted in ERC20 where is msg.value coming from?


[11/10/2022 17:06] hiroshilooksrare
it's not just ERC20, it can be ERC20 + ETH orders


[11/10/2022 17:07] hiroshilooksrare
pure ETH -> LooksRareAggregator
ERC20 -> ERC20EnabledLooksRareAggregator
ERC20 + ETH -> ERC20EnabledLooksRareAggregator


[11/10/2022 17:07] samater_
Makes sense, thanks


[11/10/2022 17:07] koolexc
Any hint how to make compiling faster ?


[11/10/2022 17:08] hiroshilooksrare
`FOUNDRY_PROFILE=local forge build`


[11/10/2022 17:08] hiroshilooksrare
did you run with the local profile


[11/10/2022 17:09] koolexc
when building it is fast


[11/10/2022 17:09] koolexc
but when running tests and I make a change then it needs to compile first so it is taking longer time


[11/10/2022 17:09] hiroshilooksrare
did you run forge test with FOUNDRY_PROFILE=local?


[11/10/2022 17:11] koolexc
Thanks. looks like much faster now!

🙁 

[11/11/2022 19:26] hiroshilooksrare
I will take a look, meanwhile you can just run the build without this test, it should not affect your audit as it's a test not the actual code


[11/11/2022 19:27] illilli000
`foundryup`?


[11/11/2022 19:27] deathstore

?


[11/11/2022 19:27] hiroshilooksrare
it's to upgrade your foundry

Hey. When we can expect the results of this contest?

Never

Ideally I'll try to wrap up the judging so it goes to post judging Q&A at the end of this week, so you can expect the results sometime next week at best
